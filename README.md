# **Automatic Detection of COVID-19 from *Ultrasound* Data**
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jannisborn/covid19_pocus_ultrasound.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jannisborn/covid19_pocus_ultrasound)
**NOTE**: This is an ultrasound data collection initiative for COVID-19. Please
help growing the database or contribute new models.

We develop a **computer vision** approach for the diagnosis of **COVID-19** infections
from **Point-of-care Ultrasound** (POCUS) recordings. Find the arXiv preprint
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12084). This is the **first
approach to automatically detect COVID-19 from ultrasound**. Next to the code
for our model and our websitet on [https://pocovidscreen.org](https://pocovidscreen.org), we also make a
**dataset** available. This complements the current data collection initiaves that only focus
on CT or X-Ray data. The data includes a total of >70 videos (> 1000 images) of COVID 19 patients, as well
as pneumonia and healthy lungs. 
**Please help growing the database!**


## Motivation:
From the machine learning community, ultrasound has not gained much attention in the context of COVID-19 so far, in contrast to CT and X-Ray scanning.
Many voices from the medical community, however, have advocated for a more
prominent role of ultrasound in the current pandemic (details below).
#### Why imaging?
Biomedical imaging has the potential to complement conventional diagnostic procedures for COVID (such as RT-PCR or immuno assays). It can provide a fast assessment and guide downstream diagnostic tests, in particular in triage situations. In the current pandemic, prognostic predictions were already shown to help saving the scarce time of doctors by reducing the time spent to make the right decision [(Shan et. al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04655).
Two studies reported that CT imaging can detect COVID-19 at higher sensitivity rate compared to RT-PCR (98% vs 71%, [Fang et. al., 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020200432) and 88% vs. 59% [Ai et. al., 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020200642)).
#### Why ultrasound?
However, ultrasound data was shown to be highly
[**correlated with CT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165267/), the gold standard for lung diseases. Instead of CT,
ultrasound is **non-invasive**, **cheap**, **portable** (bedside execution),
**repeatable** and **available in almost all medical facilities**. But even for
trained doctors detecting COVID-19 from ultrasound data is challenging and
time-consuming. Since their time is scarce, there is an urgent need to simplify,
fasten & automatize the detection of COVID-19.

This project is a **proof of concept**, showing that a CNN is able to learn to distinguish between COVID-19,
Pneumonia and healthy patients with an **accuracy of 89%** and **sensitivity for
COVID of 96\%**. This is by no means clinically relevant and a lot of further
work needs to be done, e.g. on differentiating COVID from other viral pneumonias.

#### Evidence for ultrasound
   - Peer-reviewed publications from the medical community suggesting to use more **ultrasound
     for COVID-19**:

        respiratory medicine* (IF:
        22)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30120-X/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR2kDbxpYTSjoj3Nl_B-nOhLZL66mQLUBVBCdzn6zEG5ObLKq9oXhPZDXHQ)

- You can donate your lung ultrasound recordings directly on our website: [https://pocovidscreen.org](https://pocovidscreen.org)
- Please help us to find more data! Open an
  [issue](https://github.com/jannisborn/covid19_pocus_ultrasound/issues) if you
  identified a promising data source. Please check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t-tLMjMod6W-nAjkuxmO0CLsiyalFIOp92k_XD_yeo8/edit#gid=1181682638) whether the data is
  already included. Useful contributions are:

- We are mostly looking for *healthy* lung recordings (at the moment we have *more* data for COVID than for healthy
  lungs)
